### 2026-05-08: Data Pipeline Architecture — implemented

**By:** Brett (Data Generator & Loader)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**What:** Greenfield data pipeline under `data_pipeline/` — 18 Python files + 1 SQL + pyproject.toml. Covers 130K employees, 2.6M edges, vector embeddings, FTS indexes. Key choices: psycopg2 + ThreadedConnectionPool over asyncpg, Cypher MERGE for idempotency, DiskANN→HNSW fallback at runtime, Faker locale-per-country for culturally appropriate names, hardcoded reference data (46 locations, 96 skills, 39 certs) for ontology fidelity.  
**Impact:** Parker should use `properties->>'key'` index pattern for graph queries. Kane should use `employee_fts` and `employee_embeddings` relational tables as the search API interface.

### 2026-05-08: Requirements decomposition — fresh start

**By:** Ash (Scrum Master)  
**What:** Complete fresh requirements decomposition from source CSVs. 72 files: 1 product spec, 1 backlog, 1 traceability matrix, 17 epics, 52 user stories. 30 of 48 features.csv entries identified as gaps needing backlog grooming.  
**Why:** Clean decomposition from scratch for TalentIQ v2 platform.  
**Impact:** All team members should use `docs/` as the canonical requirements source.
